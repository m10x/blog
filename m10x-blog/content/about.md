My name is Maximilian Hildebrand aka m10x, I'm 23 years old and I'm pursuing a master's degree in IT-Security @ Ruhr-Universität Bochum.

My hobby is IT-Security and I'm also an IT-Security working student. I like to compete at Capture The Flags and I try to do short but understandable Videos and WriteUps.

I do this as repetition and hope that some of you might find them useful!

I've spend most my time @ [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/users/profile/19366) and achieved the rank Pro Hacker with ~50 Owned Systems.
